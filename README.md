# SocialMediaDatabases
This is the repo for our CS-4307 Database Systems Social Media Assignment, named Dissonance
Our Intention was to create a Discord Clone
Discord is made up of Servers with a variety of Channels within.
It is within the channels that users communicate;
You can also ban people from your server.

You can find our schema in schema.txt

To Run Tests:
1. Run setup.py
	- This file will setup the database
2. Run server.py
	- This is our UI for our social Network




2. Run dissonance_database.db
	- This fill will run the tests automatically
